# Mem0 Stack Reorganization Fix Report

## Problem Summary
After moving the mem0/server folder from archives to the main project, the system experienced:
1. Build failures due to Poetry → uv migration
2. Database connection errors ("cursor already closed")
3. Missing port mappings preventing API access

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Package Manager Migration (Poetry → uv)
- **Issue**: Dockerfile still referenced `poetry.lock` and tried to install Poetry
- **Impact**: Container build failures
- **Root Cause**: Migration to uv package manager left outdated Dockerfile

### 2. Environment Variable Mismatch
- **Issue**: Container names changed but .env file had old references
- **Impact**: Database connection failures
- **Details**:
  - `POSTGRES_HOST=postgres` → should be `postgres-mem0`
  - `NEO4J_URI=bolt://neo4j:7687` → should be `bolt://neo4j-mem0:7687`

### 3. Missing Port Mapping
- **Issue**: docker-compose.yml lacked port mapping for mem0 service
- **Impact**: API inaccessible from host
- **Fix**: Added `ports: - "127.0.0.1:8000:8000"`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Dockerfile (mem0/server/dev.Dockerfile)
```dockerfile
# Removed Poetry installation and poetry.lock reference
- RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
- COPY poetry.lock .

# Use pip directly with pyproject.toml
RUN pip install -e .[graph]
```

### 2. Updated Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres-mem0  # Updated from 'postgres'
NEO4J_URI=bolt://neo4j-mem0:7687  # Updated from 'neo4j'
```

### 3. Added Port Mapping (docker-compose.yml)
```yaml
mem0:
  ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:8000:8000"
```

### 4. Added Health Check Endpoint (mem0/server/main.py)
```python
@app.get("/health", summary="Health check endpoint")
def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "service": "mem0"}
```

## Results

### ✅ Fixed Issues
- Database connections now working properly
- Memory retrieval functional (3 memories retrieved successfully)
- Health endpoint operational
- Container builds successfully
- Port mapping allows API access

### ❌ Remaining Issues
- OpenAI API key is invalid/expired
- Memory creation and search fail due to API key issue
- Test success rate improved from 15.4% to 23.1%

## Next Steps
1. Update OpenAI API key in .env file
2. Consider adding connection pooling for better database stability
3. Add comprehensive health checks for all dependencies
4. Document the uv package manager usage for future developers

## Key Takeaway
The reorganization exposed dependency on outdated configuration. When moving services between environments, ensure:
- Package manager configurations are updated
- Container names in environment variables match docker-compose services
- Port mappings are preserved
- Health checks are implemented for monitoring
