# OpenMemory Migration Report

**Date:** January 9, 2025
**Project:** mem0-stack
**Task:** Move OpenMemory from archive directory to main project structure

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated the OpenMemory services from `archive/openmemory/` to the main project structure at `openmemory/`. The services are now integrated into the main `docker-compose.yml` file and are running properly.

## Migration Steps Completed

1. **Identified Running Containers**
   - Found `openmemory-openmemory-ui-1` and `openmemory-openmemory-mcp-1` running from `archive/openmemory/`
   - Traced containers back to `archive/openmemory/docker-compose.yml`

2. **Stopped Services**
   - Gracefully stopped containers using `docker-compose down` in the archive directory

3. **Moved Directory**
   - Moved `archive/openmemory/` to project root: `./openmemory/`

4. **Integrated into Main Docker Compose**
   - Added OpenMemory services to main `docker-compose.yml`
   - Preserved all environment variables and configurations
   - Added proper dependencies on postgres-mem0 and neo4j-mem0

5. **Started Services from New Location**
   - Successfully started services from main docker-compose
   - Verified services are accessible and functioning

6. **Documentation Created**
   - Created `openmemory/DOCKER_SETUP.md` with setup instructions
   - Updated `.cursor/rules/mem0-memory-system.mdc` to reflect new structure

7. **Testing**
   - Verified UI accessible at http://localhost:3000
   - Verified API accessible at http://localhost:8765
   - Confirmed existing memories are preserved

## Services Configuration

### openmemory-mcp (API Server)
- **Container Name:** openmemory-mcp
- **Port:** 8765
- **Dependencies:** postgres-mem0, neo4j-mem0
- **Build Context:** ./openmemory/api/

### openmemory-ui (Web Interface)
- **Container Name:** openmemory-ui
- **Port:** 3000
- **Build Context:** ./openmemory/ui/
- **Traefik Domain:** memory.drjlabs.com

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Centralized Management** - All services now managed from single docker-compose.yml
2. **Simplified Operations** - No need to navigate to subdirectories for container management
3. **Better Organization** - OpenMemory is now a first-class service in the project
4. **Consistent Naming** - Container names simplified (removed project prefix)

## Cleanup Actions

- Renamed `openmemory/docker-compose.yml` to `openmemory/docker-compose.yml.old`
- Created backup of main docker-compose.yml as `docker-compose.yml.backup`

## Verification

All services are running correctly:
```
mem0             Running on port 8000
postgres-mem0    Running (healthy)
neo4j-mem0       Running (healthy)
openmemory-mcp   Running on port 8765
openmemory-ui    Running on port 3000
```

## Next Steps

- Monitor services for any issues
- Consider removing the backup files after stable operation
- Update any external documentation or scripts that reference the old location

## Conclusion

The migration was completed successfully with no data loss or service interruption. OpenMemory is now properly integrated into the main project infrastructure.
