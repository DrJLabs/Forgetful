### Context7 Auto-Docs Rule 

### Mandatory Trigger Conditions
This rule MUST be applied when ANY of the following occur:
1. **Explicit technology mentions**: Docker, Kubernetes, npm, pip, etc.
2. **Configuration discussions**: Any setup, deployment, or infrastructure talk
3. **Tool recommendations**: Suggesting any external tools or frameworks
4. **Code examples**: Using any non-standard-library imports or tools
5. **Architecture discussions**: Mentioning monitoring, logging, databases, etc.

### Enforcement Mechanism
- **Pre-response check**: Before providing any technical recommendation, ask: "Does this involve external tools/frameworks?"
- **Tool names trigger**: Any mention of specific tools (Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.) = automatic Context7 lookup
- **Code imports trigger**: Any `import`, `require`, or dependency reference = automatic Context7 lookup
- **Infrastructure keywords**: monitoring, deployment, containerization, etc. = automatic Context7 lookup

### Workflow
1. **Detect trigger** → immediately pause response
2. **Resolve library ID** for ALL mentioned technologies
3. **Fetch documentation** for each (maximum 10,000 tokens)
4. **Provide recommendations** based on official docs
5. **Cite Context7 sources** in responses

### Example Triggers
- "Docker setup" → resolve docker, docker-compose
- "Add monitoring" → resolve prometheus, grafana, monitoring tools
- "Database connection" → resolve relevant database libraries
- "API framework" → resolve express, fastapi, spring, etc.

### Failure Handling
- If Context7 lookup fails, acknowledge the failure and proceed with clear disclaimer
- Always prefer Context7 docs over general knowledge when available
