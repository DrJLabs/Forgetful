## 🔍 **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **Measurement Best Practices**
1. **Use `time` command** for real process timing (not subprocess overhead)
2. **Strip ANSI color codes** when parsing pytest output
3. **Isolate components** - measure collection vs execution separately
4. **Statistical validation** - multiple runs with standard deviation

### **Optimization Principles**
1. **Measure first** - establish accurate baselines before optimization claims
2. **Validate improvements** - ensure claims match reproducible reality
3. **Scale appropriately** - more workers ≠ better performance
4. **Document methodology** - ensure results are reproducible

### **Infrastructure Requirements**
1. **Automated benchmarking** prevents false performance claims
2. **Regression detection** catches performance degradation early
3. **Continuous monitoring** maintains performance standards over time
4. **Proper tooling** eliminates measurement errors and false conclusions
