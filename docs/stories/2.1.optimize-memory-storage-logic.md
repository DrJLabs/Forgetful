- Priority is on autonomous AI agent usage patterns for coding tasks
- All optimizations should maintain backward compatibility
- Performance improvements should be measurable and documented
- Testing should include real autonomous agent scenarios

## Testing
- Unit tests for all optimized storage functions
- Integration tests for autonomous agent usage patterns
- Performance benchmarks for storage optimization
- Validation tests for deduplication effectiveness
- Regression tests to ensure no functionality breaks
