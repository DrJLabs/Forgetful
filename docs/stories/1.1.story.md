# Story 1.1: Memory Operation Performance Optimization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** AI agent executing code,
**I want** memory operations to complete in under 100ms,
**so that** I can retrieve context and store information without slowing down code execution.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All memory CRUD operations complete within 100ms under normal load
2. Memory search operations return results within 50ms for typical queries
3. Batch memory operations maintain sub-100ms per-operation performance
4. Performance metrics are tracked and logged for continuous monitoring
5. Caching layer optimizes frequent memory access patterns
6. Database query optimization ensures efficient vector searches
