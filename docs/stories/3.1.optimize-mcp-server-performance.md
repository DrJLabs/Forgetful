# Story 3.1: Optimize Existing MCP Server Performance

## Status
Draft

## Story

2. Tune current MCP message processing for sub-50ms autonomous memory operations
3. Enhance existing MCP connection pooling for continuous AI agent usage
4. Improve current MCP request batching for efficient autonomous operations
5. Optimize existing MCP server resource usage for sustained autonomous workloads
6. Fine-tune current MCP protocol timeouts for autonomous operation reliability
