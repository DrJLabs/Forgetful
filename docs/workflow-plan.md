**Created Date**: January 27, 2025
**Project**: mem0-stack Testing Infrastructure
**Type**: Brownfield Enhancement
**Status**: Active
**Estimated Planning Duration**: 6-8 weeks (parallel execution)

- Track B: QA Agent begins unit test implementation (Step 1.3)

**Week 2-3 Parallel Tracks:**
- Track A: QA Agent implements API contract tests (Step 2.1)
- Track B: Security Specialist implements security suite (Step 2.2)
- Track C: DevOps Agent prepares CI/CD integration (Step 2.3)

**Week 4-5 Parallel Tracks:**
- Track A: Dev Agent implements performance testing (Step 3.1)
- Track B: QA Agent implements E2E testing (Step 3.2)
- Track C: QA Agent implements operational testing (Step 3.3)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Disruption Risk**: All testing additions are non-destructive to existing functionality
- **Performance Risk**: Test execution time monitored and optimized
- **Complexity Risk**: Incremental implementation with immediate value delivery
- **Maintenance Risk**: Automated test maintenance and clear documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm this plan** matches your merge-safety goals
2. **Start immediately** with Phase 1 parallel tracks:
   - `@dev` - Set up pytest infrastructure
   - `@qa` - Begin unit test implementation
3. **Track progress** using this plan as your checklist
4. **Review decisions** at each decision point

## Notes

This plan prioritizes **preventing bugs from reaching merge** by building comprehensive pre-merge validation. The parallel execution approach maximizes your solo+agents capability while delivering immediate value in preventing the issues bugbot has been catching.
