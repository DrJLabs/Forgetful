# mem0-stack Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Project Name**: mem0-stack  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: MVP Ready for Development

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
Based on chronological priority for autonomous AI memory management:

• **Phase 1 - System Reliability**: Establish ultra-reliable memory operations with sub-100ms response times for autonomous AI agent usage
• **Phase 2 - Intelligent Memory**: Optimize existing memory storage and retrieval logic for autonomous AI decision-making  
• **Phase 3 - MCP Integration Excellence**: Enhance existing MCP protocol integration for seamless autonomous operations
• **Phase 4 - Production Hardening**: Optimize existing monitoring and operational systems for autonomous AI agent usage patterns
• **Phase 5 - Platform Maturity**: Deliver autonomous AI memory management that enhances coding productivity through intelligent context preservation

### Background Context
Large Language Models fundamentally lack memory between conversations, forcing AI agents to repeatedly establish context and losing valuable project knowledge across sessions. This creates significant friction in autonomous AI development workflows where agents need to maintain continuity and learn from previous interactions.

The mem0-stack project provides a self-hosted solution for autonomous AI memory management, enabling AI agents to store and retrieve context seamlessly during code execution. Rather than manual memory management, the system provides intelligent autonomous memory operations that enhance AI agent decision-making and project continuity. The focus is on Cursor integration where AI agents can autonomously manage memory while executing coding tasks.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
**Cursor-First Design**: The primary user experience is seamless integration within Cursor IDE through MCP protocol. The existing OpenMemory UI serves as a secondary administrative interface for bulk operations, system monitoring, and management tasks that can't be handled efficiently within the IDE.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **MCP-Native**: Primary interactions happen through Cursor's AI assistant interface
- **Autonomous Integration**: AI agents manage memory operations without user intervention
- **Existing UI Administration**: OpenMemory UI for bulk management and system monitoring
- **API-First Design**: All functionality accessible through well-documented REST APIs

### Core Screens and Views
**Primary Interface (Cursor MCP Integration):**
1. **Memory Operations via AI Chat** - All CRUD operations through natural language in Cursor
2. **Contextual Memory Search** - Semantic search integrated into AI conversations
3. **Memory Creation from Context** - Save important conversation context directly
4. **Autonomous Memory Management** - AI agents store and retrieve context automatically

**Secondary Interface (Existing OpenMemory UI):**
1. **Current OpenMemory Dashboard** - Use existing interface for administration
2. **Existing Memory Management** - Leverage current browse/search/edit functionality
3. **System Configuration** - Use existing settings and configuration interfaces
4. **Monitoring/Health Dashboard** - System status and performance metrics

### Accessibility: Inherited from OpenMemory UI
Maintain current accessibility standards of existing OpenMemory interface.

### Branding: Existing OpenMemory Design
Use current OpenMemory UI design and branding - no custom UI development needed for MVP.

### Target Device and Platforms: Desktop-First (Backend Focus)
Primary usage through Cursor on desktop. OpenMemory UI provides web-based administration when needed.
