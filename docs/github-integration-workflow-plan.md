**Created Date**: January 15, 2024
**Project**: mem0-stack
**Type**: Brownfield Enhancement
**Status**: Active
**Estimated Planning Duration**: 2-3 hours

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting this workflow, ensure you have:

- [ ] GitHub organization or personal account access
- [ ] GitHub Projects enabled on target repositories
- [ ] Understanding of current project tracking pain points
- [ ] Access to mem0-stack development environment
- [ ] Database backup capability for schema changes
- [ ] Staging environment for testing GitHub integration
- [ ] GitHub API rate limits and usage policies reviewed

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Complexity
- **Medium-High**: Requires OAuth flow, webhook handling, and API rate limiting
- **Dependencies**: GitHub API availability, user authentication state
- **Performance**: Consider caching strategies for GitHub data

### Rollback Strategy
- **Database**: Maintain migration rollback scripts
- **Feature Flags**: Implement toggles for GitHub integration features
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure system works without GitHub connectivity

### Testing Requirements
- **API Mocking**: Mock GitHub API responses for unit tests
- **Integration Testing**: Test with real GitHub projects in staging
- **Performance Testing**: Verify webhook processing and rate limiting

## Customization Options

Based on your project needs, you may:
- Skip advanced project automation features if focusing on basic tracking
- Add custom project templates if your workflow requires specialized views
- Choose simplified authentication if only targeting individual developers
- Implement phased rollout if you have multiple teams using the system

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limiting**: GitHub API has usage limits that could affect functionality
- **Authentication Complexity**: OAuth flow adds complexity to user experience
- **Data Consistency**: Webhook failures could cause synchronization issues

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Teams may resist changing existing project tracking habits
- **Feature Scope**: GitHub Projects API limitations may not meet all requirements
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Additional integration points increase system complexity

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** and confirm it aligns with your project tracking goals
2. **Gather prerequisites** using the checklist above
3. **Start with analysis phase**: Begin with `*agent analyst` to analyze requirements
4. **Or jump to specific agent**: Start with `*agent pm` if you have clear requirements

## Recommended Agent Sequence

1. **@analyst** - Start here to understand GitHub Projects API and current system gaps
2. **@architect** - Design the integration architecture and data flow
3. **@pm** - Create comprehensive PRD with user stories and acceptance criteria
4. **@po** - Break down into epics and manageable stories
5. **@sm** - Create detailed development-ready stories
6. **@dev** - Implement the integration (multiple cycles)
7. **@qa** - Validate and test the complete integration

## Success Metrics

This integration will be successful when:
- [ ] GitHub projects are visible within the mem0-stack interface
- [ ] Issues and milestones sync bidirectionally
- [ ] Users can track project progress without leaving the system
- [ ] Integration handles errors gracefully and provides user feedback
- [ ] System performance remains acceptable with GitHub data loading

## Notes

- Consider implementing this integration behind a feature flag initially
- Plan for GitHub API deprecations and version changes
- Document the integration thoroughly for future maintenance
- Consider user training needs for new project tracking features
